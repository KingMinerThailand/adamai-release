Release packages are published as GitHub Release assets, not committed to git,
so package size can grow past GitHub's 50 MiB repository warning threshold.
If the archive grows beyond GitHub Release asset limits (currently under 2 GiB
per file), publish it to object storage/CDN instead and run the installer with
`ADAMAI_RELEASE_URL=<package-url>`.
